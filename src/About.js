          <p>Wait Time is a user-driven app designed to provide useful feedback to customers and retail companies about the length of checkout lines, whether at the grocery store or your local fast food restaurant.  The app allows for customers to time how long it takes to be served and to also provide immediate one-line feedback about the experience.  A user can view estimated and average wait times for a store, and see how their wait time stacks up against the norm (and if another store is typically faster).</p>

          <p>In addition, the app includes map functionality that will allow a user to get a snapshot of estimated wait times in nearby stores.  Users will also be able to view specific store statistics.</p>

          <p>Wait Time is the final student project of Maxwell Benton, a graduate of the Flatiron School immersive web development program in New York City</p>
